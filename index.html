    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>
       <ul> <li>Hey I am Kabir (20 year old), my known languages are Hindi and English.
        I am currently persuing bachlors of business administration
        in business analytics domain from Christ deemed to be university.
        I want to be a succefull and independent person, My actual
        goal is even not kown to me, just husteling and going with the flow.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Before COVID I was carrying a different mindset(I was in a football academy). It doesn't implies that I gave up, 
            after my 12th I tried to approach my previous football acadmey and even I practiced 
            for athletics(100 m race),but
            that also might not written in my destiny as I got injured.
            First covid! than injury! this situation was inverse from that fomous dialogue of SRK "jab kisi 
            cheez ko poori shiddat se paana chaaho to poori kaaynaat tumhe usse milane ki shazish me lag jati hai".

        </li></ul>

        <ul><li>    
        I even took one year drop for athletics but in the end it didn't even matter.
        Yes, it hurts but it can not resist me to go further. So I chose to be in 
        management field(I know it was whole different thing from what I did before), because I don't want to stop a point like this.
