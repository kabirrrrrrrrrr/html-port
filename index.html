    <h2>Brief about me</h2>
    <p>
       <ul> <li>Hey I am Kabir (20 year old), my known languages are Hindi and English.
        I am currently persuing bachlors of business administration
        in business analytics from Christ deemed to be university Pune,Lavasa campus. I shouldn't say much about 
        life goals but I want to be a succefull and independent person. Presently I am just 
        husteling and going with the flow.</li></ul>
        <ul><li>
            Before COVID I was carrying a different mindset(I was in a football academy). Post COVID-19(2 yrs later) I tried to approach my previous football acadmey and even I practiced 
            for athletics(100 m race),but I got injured.
            First covid! than injury! this situation was inverse from that fomous dialogue of SRK "jab kisi 
            cheez ko poori shiddat se paana chaaho to poori kaaynaat tumhe usse milane ki shazish me lag jati hai".

        </li></ul>

        <ul><li>    
        I took one year drop for athletics but in the end it didn't even matter.
        Yes, it hurts but it can not resist me to go further. A simple answer to the simple question "why bba?" is 
        to explore and to know myself more. I think it was better than stopping at a point like this.
